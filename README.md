# WebGPU Ocean (Full-width Edition)

This is an optimized fork of the excellent [WebGPU Ocean](https://github.com/matsuoka-601/WebGPU-Ocean) project, modified for a simplified full-width experience. Taking inspiration from classic LiquidFun examples, this version adds dynamic wave splashing on window resize, creating an interactive fluid experience. 

For a deep dive into the underlying concepts and techniques, check out the detailed walkthrough on [Codrops](https://tympanus.net/codrops/2025/02/26/webgpu-fluid-simulations-high-performance-real-time-rendering/).

This real-time 3D fluid simulation is implemented in WebGPU and works on browsers that support the WebGPU API.
